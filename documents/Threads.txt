##  POSIX Threads in C

We are going to use **POSIX threads (pthreads)**, which provide a standardized API for multithreading in C and C++. All the pthread functions are declared in the **`pthread.h`** header file, and programs using pthreads must be compiled with the **`-pthread`** flag.

## 🛠️ Thread Management with `pthread`

### ### A. **Creating a Thread**

Function:

```c
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread,
                   const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                   void *(*start_routine)(void *),
                   void *arg);
```

#### Parameters:

* `pthread_t *thread`
  → Pointer to a `pthread_t` variable where the system stores the thread ID after creation.

* `const pthread_attr_t *attr`
  → Thread attributes (e.g., stack size, scheduling policy). Use `NULL` for default attributes.

* `void *(*start_routine)(void *)`
  → Function that the thread will execute. Must match this signature. It returns a `void*` and takes a `void*` as input.

* `void *arg`
  → Pointer to argument passed to the thread function (can be `NULL`, or a pointer to a struct, etc.)

#### Example:

```c
pthread_t tid;
pthread_create(&tid, NULL, my_function, NULL);
```

### ### B. **Waiting for a Thread to Finish (`pthread_join`)**

Function:

```c
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);
```

#### Purpose:

* Waits for the specified thread to terminate.
* Retrieves the return value of the thread if needed.
* Ensures that resources used by the thread are properly released.

#### Parameters:

* `pthread_t thread`
  → The thread ID of the thread to wait for.

* `void **retval`
  → Pointer to a `void*` to store the thread’s return value. Use `NULL` if you don't care about the return value.

#### Example:

```c
void *res;
pthread_join(tid, &res);
```

---

### ### C. **Exiting a Thread (`pthread_exit`)**

Function:

```c
void pthread_exit(void *retval);
```

#### Purpose:

* Terminates the calling thread.
* Can optionally return a value to the thread that calls `pthread_join`.

#### Notes:

* If `main()` calls `pthread_exit`, the process continues running until all threads have finished.
* If `main()` returns or calls `exit()`, the entire process including all threads is terminated.

#### Example:

```c
pthread_exit(NULL);
```
